    "\n",
    "This tutorial will provide an overview of asynchronous programming. It will cover conceptual elements of asynchronous programming, the basics of Python's async API's, and an example implementation of an asynchronous web scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronous programs are straightfoward: start a task, wait for it to finish, repeat until all tasks have executed; however, waiting wastes valuable CPU cycles. Asynchronous programs remedy this problem by using context-switching to interleave tasks in order to minimize processor idle-time, minimize total program execution time, and improve program responsiveness. \n",

    "## Simultaneous Chess Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the benefit of asynchronous programming, consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten opponents have each challenged you to a game of chess. Since you are very good at chess, you take three minutes per move. Each of your opponents take five minutes. Each full game takes twenty moves per player, or forty moves in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time it takes to play one full game is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    num_moves * my_move_time + num_moves * opponent_move_time\n",
    "    = 20 * 3 + 20 * 5\n",
    "    = 160 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Playing through each of the 10 games sequentially would take about 27 hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, however, that each time you make a move, you then spend 5 minutes idle while you wait for the other player to respond. For each 160 minute game, you spend 100 minutes waiting -- that's 62.5% of each game, and 1000 minutes across all ten games. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of waiting, suppose that, as soon as you finish making your move in a given game, you immediately progress to the next opponent. Starting with opponent 1, you take 3 minutes to make a move. Then you progress on to opponent `2, 3, ..., 10`. When you've finished your move with the 10th opponent, you return to the game with opponent 1. Let's call this process a _round_.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you're progressing through opponents 2...10, opponent 1 has `(num_opponents - 1) * my_move_time = (10-1) * 3 = 27 minutes > 5 minutes` to think and make their next move -- therefore, when you come back to opponent 1 at the start of the next round, you can immediately make your move without waiting for them to finish up. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, as long as each opponent takes less than `(num_opponents - 1) * my_move_time` to make their move, you will spend no time waiting. Each round will take `num_opponents*my_move_time = 10*3 = 30 minutes`. Since we're assuming each game consists of 40 moves and we complete 2 moves per game in each round (your move and the opponent's move), it will take 20 rounds to complete all the games. So, we have that all 10 games will take `30 minutes * 20 rounds = 600 minutes = 10 hours`, which is 270% speedup overall over the sequential approach.\n",

    "Another advantage of asynchronous programming is improved responsiveness. Say you have in a program an ordered list of independent tasks to be executed, and the first task is a relatively long-running (heavy-weight) one. If the program was executed sequentially, it would first have to spend a significant amount of time to finish the first task (as it is a long-running task) before it moves to the other faster, lighter tasks.\n",

    "## Coroutines, Event Loops, and Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines, event loops, and futures are the essential elements of an asynchronous program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **event loop** handles the task-switching aspect, or execution flow, of the program. It keeps track of all the tasks that are to be run asynchronously and decides which of those should be executed at a given moment.\n",
    "- A **coroutine** is a special type of function that wraps around a specific task so that it can be executed asynchronously. A coroutine specifies where in the function the task-switching event should take place -- this is when the execution flow is returned from the function back to the event loop. Coroutines are typically created by the event loop, and stored internally in a task queue.\n",
    "- A **future** is a placeholder for a result returned from a coroutine. _As soon as the event loop initiates a coroutine, a corresponding future is created that stores the result of the coroutine, or an exception if one was thrown during the coroutine's execution._\n",

Again, the implementation of asynchronous programming allows that wherever the light-weight tasks are in the task queue, they will be able to finish first, thus creating better responsiveness for the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CPU-bound and Blocking Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming is said to provide us more than just better responsiveness; it provides even better execution time as we saw in the counting-down example. However, when analyzing the execution time obtained from the two versions of our Fibonacci-finding program, it was actually the sequential version that resulted in better speed. So does that mean asynchronous programming cannot really provide better speed for our programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is, it still can, but more steps are needed, specifically for the Fibonacci-finding program. In the `async_fib()` coroutine of that program, most instructions are CPU-bound tasks. This means that the program needs to access the CPU to execute the code, and no waiting/processing time can therefore be overlapped. While task-switching events still take place in our program, which will still improve its responsiveness, no instructions will be overlapping each other and no additional speed can thus be gained. In fact, since there is considerable overhead regarding the implementation and initialization of asynchrnous elements, our asynchronous program might, and did, take even longer to execute than the original synchronous program. The same goes for blocking tasks, which also prevent multiple tasks to be overlapped with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, does not mean that if your program contains heavy CPU-bound or blocking tasks, asynchronous programming is out of the question. All execution in an asynchronous program, if not specified otherwise, occurs entirely in the same thread and process, and CPU-bound or blocking tasks can thus prevent program instructions from overlapping each other. However, this is not the case if the tasks are distributed to separate threads/processes. In other words, threading and multiprocessing can help asynchronous programs with blocking instructions achieve better execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The concurrent.futures Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Python does provide an option to implement this specification: the `concurrent.futures module`, which is designed to be a high-level interface for implementing asynchronous tasks. Specifically, `concurrent.futures` works seamlessly with the `asyncio` module, and in addition provides an an abstract class called `Executor`, which contains the skeleton of the two main classes that implement asynchronous threading and multiprocessing respectively (as suggested by their names): `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into the API from `concurrent.futures`, let us discuss the theoretical basics of asynchronous threading/multiprocessing, and how it plays into the framework of asynchronous programming that asyncio provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we have three major elements in our ecosystem of asynchronous programming: the event loop, coroutines and their corresponding futures.

    "\n",
    "One of the most common applications of asynchronous programming is data collection via web-scraping. This is the process of automating HTTP requests to various websites and extracting specific information from their HTML source code. While intereacting with multiple web servers simultanesouly, it is possible that some servers will take longer to process our requests than others. This is the perfect opportunity to implement asynchronous programming, as we can overlap the time spent waiting on the servers that take longer to response and the time we process the responses that are already returned from other servers.\n",

Furthermore, we also read the returned HTML in chunks asynchronously using the `read()` function for the content attribute of the response object--this means that after reading 1024 bytes of the current response, the execution flow will be released back to the event loop and the task-switching event will take place.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we have learnt about the foudnational idea of asynchronous programming and the main elements of any asynchronous program. We have seen the process of implementing asynchronous programs in Python via various examples, and we finally designed a simply asynchronous web-scraping engine. Throughout this tutorial, various points about the advantages of asynchronous programming in comparison with traditional sequential programming such as better speed and improved responsiveness have also been made."
